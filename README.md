# shortenEm
A url shortener and intro to node-express and knex with postgresql 

## Overview

an introduction to full stack application. We built a url shortening service that takes a long url, shortens it using a trimmed md5 hash, and stores it in a database.
we used jquery for the front end to remember how to build basic javascript applications without an MVC like ember or react-redux, node-express for our server, and connected the server to a postgresql db using knex.
